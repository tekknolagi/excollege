            This document will eventually turn into the course website, so keep
            it bookmarked. We will post important readings, assignments, and
            helpful resources here.
            </p>
            <p>
            Anyway, you probably have some questions...
            </p>

            <h2>What is the course called?</h2>
            <p>
            It's called <i>Tech Trends and Careers: Tufts and Beyond</i>
            <sup id="fnref:naming"><a href="#fn:naming" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.
            </p>

            <h2>Who should take this class?</h2>
            <p>
            Anyone, really! We're trying to get Tufts people settled into
            fulfilling careers after they graduate. We will reserve a good
            amount of space for freshmen and sophomores who might otherwise be
            rather confused.
            </p>

            <h2>Why should I take it?</h2>
            <p>
            Ever wonder what options you might have in tech? Already interested
            in tech but not sure how to start your job search? Already in the
            job search but need some help? This class is the right class for
            you!
            </p>
            <p>
            We're going to try and get people in this class interested in
            one topic or another, started on a personal project, and generally
            plugged in to this wild new world of computer science.
            </p>
            <div class="para">
                Here's a brief list of things the class will likely cover:
                <ol>
                    <li>What career options are available to you</li>
                    <li>Hot topics in computer science</li>
                    <li>How to start and complete a personal project</li>
                    <li>An overview of the job applicatoin process</li>
                    <li>An overview of the interview</li>
                    <li>How negotating works</li>
                    <li>Lifecycle of a project</li>
                    <li>How to write a technical specification</li>
                    <li>How to interact with others in the workplace</li>
                    <li>Entrepreneurship and startups</li>
                    <li>How to create and maintain a personal online presence</li>
                    <li>Open source software</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>
            The homework will be primarily working on your personal project and
            doing readings in between classes. Classes will be discussions and
            hands-on activities of all sorts.
            </p>

            <h2>What about the prerequisites?</h2>
            <p>
            Eh. We technically &#8220;require&#8221; COMP 11 or an equivalent,
            but really what we want is a base ability to code something, and an
            eagerness to learn more.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since people will be working on independent projects, this is
            somewhat important. But COMP 11 as a corequisite should be totally
            fine.
            </p>

            <h2>What if I don't get in?</h2>
            <p>
            Please come to the first couple lectures anyway! If someone drops,
            we would be positively thrilled for you to join.
            </p>
            <p>
            Even if you don't get into the class, you are most likely welcome
            to audit. Participating in the discussions and being motivated to
            work on a project should still prove quite helpful.
            </p>

            <h2>Who is teaching it?</h2>
            <p>
            Well,
            <blockquote>
                &#8220;<b>Yuki Zaninovich</b> and <b>Max Bernstein</b> are
                seniors majoring in Computer Science.  When they are not
                studying, eating, sleeping, being TAs for their favorite
                classes, or socializing, they are searching for jobs. Yuki has
                interned twice at Amazon, and Max has interned for such
                companies as GitHub and Facebook.&#8221;
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
            ...or so says the course catalog.
            </p>

            <h2>Will this course actually use blockchain technology or big
                data to disrupt my job hunt?</h2>
            <p>No. But you might be able to use either or both in your
            project
            <sup id="fnref:disrupt"><a href="#fn:disrupt" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.
            </p>

            <h2>So who should I contact if I have more questions?</h2>
            <p>
            You can reach both of us at
            <code>exp57 <b>at</b> bernsteinbear <b>dot</b> com</code></a>.
            We would be delighted to answer questions.

                        We didn't name it that. That's what the Ex College
                        chose for us after a back-and-forth conversation. We
                        tried to name it something like:
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>How to get a job without really trying:

                            <li><i>Let your career bloom: a non-florist's guide
                                    to tech jobs</i>, or</li>
                            <li><i>Google, SpaceX, the FBI, an NGO: Oh, the
                                    places youâ€™ll go!</i></li>
                        </ul>
                        ... but they weren't so fond of the humor.
