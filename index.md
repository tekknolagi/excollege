<p>
This document will eventually turn into the course website, so keep
it bookmarked. We will post important readings, assignments, and
helpful resources here.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, you probably have some questions...
</p>

<h2>What is the course called?</h2>
<p>
It's called <i>Tech Trends and Careers: Tufts and Beyond</i>
<sup id="fnref:naming"><a href="#fn:naming" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<h2>When is it?</h2>
<p>
Mondays and Wednesdays from 6:30pm to 7:45pm, Spring semester 2018.
</p>

<h2>Where is it?</h2>
<p>
The classroom location is currently *Miner Hall Room 225*, but we're trying to
negotiate a room in Halligan. Keep checking this page for updates.
</p>

<h2>Who should take this class?</h2>
<p>
Anyone, really! We're trying to get Tufts people settled into fulfilling
careers after they graduate. We will reserve a good amount of space for
freshmen and sophomores who might otherwise be rather confused.
</p>

<h2>Why should I take it?</h2>
<p>
Ever wonder what options you might have in tech? Already interested in tech but
not sure how to start your job search? Already in the job search but need some
help? This class is the right class for you!
</p>
<p>
We're going to try and get people in this class interested in one topic or
another, started on a personal project, and generally plugged in to this wild
new world of computer science.
</p>
<div class="para">
    Here's a brief list of things the class will likely cover:
    <ol>
        <li>What career options are available to you</li>
        <li>Hot topics in computer science</li>
        <li>How to start and complete a personal project</li>
        <li>An overview of the job application process</li>
        <li>An overview of the interview</li>
        <li>How negotating works</li>
        <li>Lifecycle of a project</li>
        <li>How to write a technical specification</li>
        <li>How to interact with others in the workplace</li>
        <li>Entrepreneurship and startups</li>
        <li>How to create and maintain a personal online presence</li>
        <li>Open source software</li>
    </ol>

<p>
The homework will be primarily working on your personal project and doing
readings in between classes. Classes will be discussions and hands-on
activities of all sorts.
</p>

<h2>What about the prerequisites?</h2>
<p>
Eh. We technically &#8220;require&#8221; COMP 11 or an equivalent, but really
what we want is a base ability to code something, and an eagerness to learn
more.
</p>
<p>
Since people will be working on independent projects, this is somewhat
important. But COMP 11 as a corequisite should be totally fine.
</p>

<h2>What if I don't get in?</h2>
<p>
Please come to the first couple lectures anyway! If someone drops, we would be
positively thrilled for you to join.
</p>
<p>
Given that the course cap is tiny, we'll try and convince the Ex College to let
us add a couple people.
</p>
<p>
At worst &mdash; if you don't get into the class &mdash; you are most likely
welcome to audit. Participating in the discussions and being motivated to work
on a project should still prove quite helpful.
</p>

<h2>Who is teaching it?</h2>
<p>
Well,
<blockquote>
    &#8220;<b>Yuki Zaninovich</b> and <b>Max Bernstein</b> are seniors majoring
    in Computer Science.  When they are not studying, eating, sleeping, being
    TAs for their favorite classes, or socializing, they are searching for
    jobs. Yuki has interned twice at Amazon, and Max has interned for such
    companies as GitHub and Facebook.&#8221;
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
...or so says the course catalog.
</p>

<h2>Will this course actually use blockchain technology or big
    data to disrupt my job hunt?</h2>
<p>No. But you might be able to use either or both in your project
<sup id="fnref:disrupt"><a href="#fn:disrupt" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<h2>So who should I contact if I have more questions?</h2>
<p>
You can reach both of us at <code>exp57 <b>at</b> bernsteinbear <b>dot</b>
    com</code>.  We would be delighted to answer questions.

            We didn't name it that. That's what the Ex College chose for us
            after a back-and-forth conversation. We tried to name it something
            like:
            <ul>
                <li><i>How to get a job without really trying: tried and true

                        jobs</i>, or</li>
                <li><i>Google, SpaceX, the FBI, an NGO: Oh, the places youâ€™ll
                        go!</i></li>
            </ul>
            ... but they weren't so fond of the humor.
